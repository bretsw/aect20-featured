# Purpose

### Reddit, over time

To compare and contrast *continuity and change* in how users contribute, interact, and converse in two subreddits

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/across-time-full.jpg")

# Data Collection

```{r, out.width = "240px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/reddit-logo.png")
```

--

- **3.5 years** (42 months): from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2019

--

- **r/Teachers:** 696,660 contributions from 55,148 contributors
  - 54,933 posts and 641,727 responses 

--

- **r/education:** 339,618 contributions from 43,711 contributors
  - 252,340 posts and 87,278 responses

# Data Analysis

```{r, out.width = "240px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/reddit-logo.png")
```

--

- Split data into 7 six-month partitions

--

- **Quantitative analysis** of individual contributions, content interactions, and social interactions

--

- **Qualitative analysis** of topics of conversation and types of discourse in top-ten posts (defined by highest voting scores) in each subreddit, and up to the top-ten responses to each of these

--

- 2 subreddits x 7 time periods x 10 posts =  **140 posts**

- 2 subreddits x 7 time periods x 100 responses = **1,460 responses**

# Discussion

# Change and Continuity

```{r, out.width = "360px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/threads.jpg")
```

--

- **r/Teachers:** 

--

  - Individual contributions increased steadily, clustering decreased, mutuality increased, topics consistently included teachersâ€™ lived experiences and pedagogy
  
--

- **r/education:** 

--

  - Posts and posters declined, thread length increased, clustering decreased, mutuality increased, topics consistently included education policy and societal factors
  
---

# Distinct Purposes

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/social-media.jpg")
```

--

- **r/Teachers:** a conversational space

--

  - many responses, long threads, educators' lived experiences

--

- **r/education:** a bulletin board space

--

  - many posts, few responses, more content-focused

---

# Significance

```{r, out.width = "360px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/scatter.jpg")
```

- Educators' self-directed learning is tied to context and has a temporal dimension

--

- Need to advise aspiring educators how best to combine different spaces for maximum effect

--

- There is value to anonymous spaces for educators

--

  - Example: Place to vent and unburden emotions from COVID-19 disruptions and frustrations

---

# Conclusion

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/across-time-full.jpg")
```

--

- Self-directed learning on Reddit is different than visiting a library

--

- Educators must work to become critical consumers of ideas and materials encountered in online spaces 

--

- Educators, instructional designers, and scholars must continue to reflect upon and analyze both opportunities and challenges of self-directed learning in the complex ecologies of social media spaces
